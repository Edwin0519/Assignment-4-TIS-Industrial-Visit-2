Reflection

The industrial visit to study immersive technology, especially VR and AR, was interesting and challenging. We leant that virtual labs provide safe, cost-effective learning experiences for dangerous or expensive activities. The VR simulators, such as cycling and flying, showed the potential of immersive technology in training and sports, bringing up physical limitations.

I was more interested in how data collecting improves performance and promotes collaboration in those settings. Also, the Unity certification workshop emphasised the need of obtaining professional credentials in order to increase employment in different industry.

Overall, the visit motivated me to learn more about immersive technology and how they could assist my future career.
